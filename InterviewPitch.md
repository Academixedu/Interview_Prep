### **1. Introduction to the Projects**

Worked on three key projects that honed my skills in full-stack development:

1. A frontend-focused mini-clone of a popular streaming app, where I built my expertise in React and integrating backend APIs.
2. A backend-focused project to master API creation and management, leveraging Spring Boot and security protocols.
3. A complete full-stack application involving frontend with React and Chart.js, backend with Spring Boot, and database management using SQL.

### **2. Technical Overview**

#### **Frontend Stack:**

- **Technologies Used:**
  - **React:** For building the user interface.
  - **Redux:** For state management.
  - **React MUI (Material-UI):** For responsive and aesthetic UI components.
  - **HTML & CSS:** For structuring and styling web pages.
  - **JavaScript:** For adding interactivity.

- **Reasons for Choices:**
  - **React's** component-based architecture allowed for modular development and reusability of components.
  - **Redux** was essential for managing the global state, particularly for handling user authentication and maintaining the state across different components.
  - **React MUI** provided pre-built components that ensured a consistent and professional look throughout the application.

#### **Backend Stack:**

- **Technologies Used:**
  - **Java Spring Boot:** For building the backend RESTful APIs.
  - **Spring Data JPA:** For database access and ORM.
  - **MongoDB:** For handling unstructured data.
  - **H2 Database:** For in-memory testing.
  - **Swagger:** For API documentation.
  - **JUnit & Mockito:** For unit and integration testing.
  - **Docker:** For containerization.
  - **AWS (EC2 & S3):** For deployment and storage.

- **Backend Connectivity:**
  - Created RESTful APIs for data retrieval and manipulation.
  - Implemented **Spring Security** for authentication and authorization.
  - Used **Swagger** for documenting APIs, making it easier for front-end developers and for testing purposes.

#### **Database Choices:**

- **MySQL:** For structured data storage like user profiles, questions, and answers.
- **MongoDB:** For unstructured data, such as comments and activity logs.
- **H2 Database:** Used during development and testing for its in-memory capabilities, speeding up the development process.

### **3. Key Features Implemented**

#### **User Authentication and Authorization:**

- Secure user registration and login functionalities.
- Implemented JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.

#### **Posting and Interactivity:**

- Allowed users to post content and interact with existing data.
- Rich text editing to format posts and responses.

#### **Search and Categorization:**

- Implemented search features based on keywords.
- Utilized tagging systems for better categorization and improved search functionality.

#### **Real-Time Notifications:**

- Integrated WebSockets to provide real-time updates and notifications to users.

#### **Responsive Design:**

- Ensured the application is mobile-friendly using responsive design principles with React MUI.

### **4. Challenges and Solutions**

#### **Challenge 1: State Management**

- **Issue:** Managing the state across multiple components was complex, especially with dynamic user interactions.
- **Solution:** Utilized **Redux** for centralized state management and used **Redux Thunk** for handling asynchronous actions.

#### **Challenge 2: Real-Time Features** (Note this is not mandatory, those interested, please learn socket.io else remove it).

- **Issue:** Implementing real-time updates for notifications without server overload.
- **Solution:** Used **Socket.IO** on both frontend and backend to establish real-time communication.

#### **Challenge 3: Database Management**

- **Issue:** Efficient handling of structured and unstructured data.
- **Solution:** Leveraged **MySQL** for structured data and **MongoDB** for unstructured data, ensuring data integrity across both systems.

#### **Challenge 4: Security**

- **Issue:** Protecting sensitive endpoints from unauthorized access.
- **Solution:** Implemented **Spring Security** with JWT for secure API access, including role-based access control.

### **5. Project Documentation and Swagger**

- **Swagger Integration:**
  - Used **Swagger UI** for documenting RESTful APIs.
  - Provided clear documentation for each endpoint, including request/response models.
  - Enabled the team to easily understand and test APIs from the documentation interface.

---

### **6. Deployment and Hosting**

#### **Docker Containerization:**

- Containerized both frontend and backend applications using Docker.
- Used Docker Compose for orchestrating multi-container applications.

#### **AWS Deployment:**

- **EC2 Instances:** Deployed backend services on AWS EC2 for scalability.
- **S3 Buckets:** Stored static assets like images and documents in AWS S3.
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk:** Used for deploying and scaling web applications.

#### **CI/CD Pipelines:**

- Integrated **Jenkins/GitHub Actions** for automated testing and deployment.
- Ensured each code commit was tested and deployed without manual intervention, reducing deployment errors.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

These projects provided hands-on experience in:

- Applying core **Java** and OOP principles.
- Gaining proficiency in **React** and **Redux** for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- Building robust backend services with **Spring Boot**, focusing on security and scalability.
- Managing both **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases.
- Utilizing **Docker** and **AWS** for seamless deployment and scaling in a cloud environment.
- Emphasizing the importance of documentation and testing in the development lifecycle.
